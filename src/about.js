                Hi! I’m Evan. I’m a veteran working to become an audio software engineer. with a background in Music
                Production. I also have an 6 year history in management in the grocery industry, though most recently, I
                worked for the US government.

                Years ago, I was a Sonar Technician in the Navy, where I spent a lot of time staring at computer
                screens, but it gave me the discipline and motivation needed to keep pursuing my dreams. It also gave me
                thorough experience with sound, audio systems, sound waves, and sonar that is unmatched in the civilian,
                non-military world.

                I've started programming through the Web Development immersive at Galvanize in Denver, CO. where I
                acquired the skills to teach myself any programming language.

                I have been completely obsessed with music for as long as I can remember, so in my spare time, I like to
                make music on the computer, go to live shows, or teach myself new ways to create. Teaching myself to
                produce music has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life. Through this, I have
                acquired knowledge of music theory, DAWs, VSTs, MIDI, sampling, music history and so much more.
                Ultimately, I would like to create audio production software for fellow producers to use and hopefully
                make it easier for new people to learn. However, I would be extremely happy working on any development
                project that incorporates audio.

                I also enjoy hiking with my dog on the weekends, hanging out with friends, and every few weeks, I jump
                out of a plane. Skydiving has become another love of mine.

                I am a Colorado native, and while I do love it here in the Denver area, I am open to relocating to
                anywhere in the world to achieve my dreams. I want to work for a company I believe in, no matter how
                small the project, or where they are located.
